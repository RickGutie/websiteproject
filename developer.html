    <h1>Services for Developers:</h1>

    <h2>Onsite BNG:</h2>
    <p>Our team can take the pain away from onsite BNG establishment and management. 
    <br><br>
    We offer a full cycle service from inital baseline assessment for onsite requirement all the way to continued management and reporting of BNG units. This allows our Developers to exit their project secure in the knowledge that the 30 year obligation to maintain and monitor the BNG onsite is being taken care of. 
    <br><br>
    A buy and forget solution to allow developers to do what they do best, and not get bogged down in lengthy obligations!</p>

    <h2>Offsite BNG:</h2>
    <p>We work with Landowners to ensure that we have a pipeline of BNG Units available across England and Wales.
    <br><br>
    We work with local councils to ensure that all aspects of BNG management are taken care of and fit into the local planning policy frameworks.
    <br><br>
    This means that when it comes to offsite BNG Unit requirements, we offer a plug and play solution. Allowing developers to purchase units "off the shelf", with both ongoing maintenance and reporting taken care of!
    </p>

    <h2>BNG Sourcing:</h2>
    <p>We help our Developers maintain a viable pipleine of developments by sourcing and establishing "Habitat Banks" in local council areas of interest.
    <br><br>
    This means that when budgeting for potential developement projects we are able to offer our Developers security in the knowledge that they will be able to move forwards with BNG Units available when needed.
    <br><br>
    This helps developerrs to future proof their pipeline and ensure that disruptions due to BNG contraints are minimised.
